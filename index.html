		<h2>ABOUT THE BREWERY</h2>
		<p>Nestled in the heart of Muskoka, Muskoka Brewery handcrafts premium beers as unique and refreshing as the region theyâ€™re from.

		Todd Lewin<br> and Bob MacDonald, what started as a very small and dedicated team has quickly grown to a passionate band of beer lovers more than 130 strong.
