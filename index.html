		<h2>ABOUT THE BREWERY</h2>
		<p>Nestled in the heart of Muskoka, Muskoka Brewery handcrafts premium beers as unique and refreshing as the region they’re from.
		<br>Founders Gary McMullen and Kirk Evans kicked open the doors of Muskoka Brewery in June of 1996. Currently owned and operated by
		Todd Lewin<br> and Bob MacDonald, what started as a very small and dedicated team has quickly grown to a passionate band of beer lovers more than 130 strong.
		<br>In short, we have a passion for great beer and we hope you get a chance to enjoy it.
		<br>Interested in learning more about our journey from our small brewery on Taylor Road to now? Check out our History.
